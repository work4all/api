# Postman Collection
Import the Collection of examples to postman. Add usernam, passwort and your api url to the corresponding variables and login.
Copy the token and add it to the variable.

In the Collection you find examples for querying customers and Articles, one example to create a new order confirmation and the query to get individual fields defintions.
All the other endpoints are quite similar. We will add more examples in the future.

For more information read the informations in the overview of the collection.
